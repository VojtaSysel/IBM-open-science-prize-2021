# IBM-open-science-prize-2021
This is a repository of the solution, which I developed for the "IBM Quantum Awards: Open Science Prize 2021". 

More information about the current competition can be found on the official page of the
[IBM Quantum Awards: Open Science Prize](https://ibmquantumawards.bemyapp.com)

Information about the Open Science Prize 2021 can be found on the [IBM's blog page](https://research.ibm.com/blog/quantum-open-science-prize).
I didn't win. To hear more about the winners please read the [article](https://research.ibm.com/blog/2022-quantum-open-science-prize) on the IBM's blog.

Please take a look at the [presentation of my solution](https://ibmquantumawards.bemyapp.com/#/projects/62407e9354879f003163ca9d) (full presentation, but on the IBM website, which is not accessible right now, maybe) 
or look at the file ["Presentation_solution.pdf"](/Presentation_solution.pdf) for a shortened version of the presentation. If you are interested in mathematics, take a look at the file ["Math_description.pdf"](/Math_description.pdf) where you will find the mathematical derivation of my solution.

The solution is a part of the jupyter notebook ["ibmq-qsim-challenge_with_my_solution.ipynb"](/ibmq-qsim-challenge_with_my_solution.ipynb). Feel free to use it.

For more information, I would be happy to answer your questions.
