# IBM-open-science-prize-2021
This is a repository of the solution, which I developed for the "IBM Quantum Awards: Open Science Prize". 

More information about the competition can be found on the official page of the
[IBM Quantum Awards: Open Science Prize](https://ibmquantumawards.bemyapp.com)

Please take a look at the [presentation of my solution](https://ibmquantumawards.bemyapp.com/#/projects/62407e9354879f003163ca9d) (full presentation, but on the IBM website, the presentation is not public right now) 
or look at the file ["Presentation_solution.pdf"](/files/Presentation_solution.pdf) for a shortened version of the presentation. If you are interested in mathematics, take a look at the file "Math_description.pdf" where you will find the mathematical derivation of my solution.

The solution is a part of the jupyter notebook "ibmq-qsim-challenge_with_my_solution.ipynb". Feel free to use it.

For more information, I would be happy to answer your questions.
